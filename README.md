No-Dues Clearance & Hall Ticket Generation System

🧠 Project Overview

The No-Dues Clearance System is a full-stack web application developed using PHP and MySQL to automate the traditional manual process of student clearance before examinations.

It ensures that students have cleared all departmental dues (Library, Accounts, Hostel, etc.) before generating their Hall Ticket.

🗂️ Database Design (Simplified)

Key Tables:

- "users" → Stores student & staff data
- "departments" → List of departments
- "dues" → Dues status per student
- "approvals" → Approval records
- "hall_tickets" → Generated tickets

---

🔄 Workflow

1. Student logs in
2. System checks dues across departments
3. Each department updates status:
   - Approved ✅
   - Pending ⏳
   - Rejected ❌
4. If all approved:
   - Hall ticket generated
5. If any rejected:
   - Student notified

---

🔐 Security Measures

- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Session management
- SQL injection prevention (prepared statements)
- Input validation & sanitization
